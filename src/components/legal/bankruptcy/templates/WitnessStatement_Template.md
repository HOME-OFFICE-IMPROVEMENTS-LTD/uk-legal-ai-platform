I, **[DEBTOR_FULL_NAME]**, of [DEBTOR_ADDRESS], state as follows:



1. I apply to annul the bankruptcy order made against me on **[BANKRUPTCY_ORDER_DATE]** by the County Court at [COURT_NAME] (Insolvency No. **[INSOLVENCY_NUMBER]**) under **section 282(1)(b) Insolvency Act 1986**, on the basis that the bankruptcy debts and costs will be paid in full to the satisfaction of the Court and the Official Receiver.



2. Funding is available from third parties to discharge in full: (i) the petition debt and costs; (ii) all provable unsecured debts including the two Barclaycard accounts; and (iii) the Official Receiver’s fixed fees and administration costs. Evidence of funding and payment confirmations will be filed promptly on the Court’s directions and following proofs of debt.



3. I am fully cooperating with the Official Receiver. Post-order rent is being held to the order of the estate, and essential outgoings are being maintained from non-estate funds to preserve asset value.



4. I respectfully request that the Court list the application at the first available date, and give case-management directions for the Official Receiver (and any trustee, if appointed) to invite proofs and report the total figure required for payment in full to the hearing date.



**Statement of Truth**
